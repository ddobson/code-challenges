// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to
// find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed
// that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to
// check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one
// that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

// Example: iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3
// Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even
